# Local Network Port Scanning — Task Report

## Overview
This repository contains the results and supporting files for a TCP SYN scan of the local IP range `192.168.1.0/24`. The scan was performed to discover live hosts and open TCP ports, capture packets for optional analysis, and assess potential security risks associated with discovered services.

## What I did
1. Determined local IP range (example used: `192.168.1.0/24`).
2. Performed a TCP SYN scan:
3. Recorded IP addresses and open ports found.
4. Took screenshots of scan output.
5. Captured packets with Wireshark/Tcpdump for a subset of hosts.
6. Researched common services on discovered ports and noted potential security risks.
